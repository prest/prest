* Who is this guy?

- Python programmer for over 12 years
- Gopher for the past year or two
- Lots of experience with relational databases and SQL
- Relatively new to graph databases
- Freelance consultant (Hire me!)


* History

“Go is the new Python”

- Expressive, clean, "feels like" writing in Python or Ruby
- Faster (by a ridiculous margin), safer, more beautiful
- However, whereas Python has a library for just about everything, Go does not…

Graphs are everywhere

- I wanted to play with graph databases
- Neo4j was the obvious choice:
- Low barrier to evaluation
- Free Software (even for enterprise - AGPL)
- Cypher!


* History (cont'd)

Problem: no Neo4j driver for Go

- But Neo4j has a REST API!
- Crappy solution: manually construct REST calls as needed
- Better solution: write a driver package

Thus Neoism was born

- Originally called “neo4j”, but that conflicted with the name of Neo4j itself, and made forking repos awkward

* Features

- Node (create/edit/relate/delete/properties)
- Relationship (create/edit/delete/properties)
- Legacy Indexing
- Cypher queries
- Batched Cypher queries

Neo4j 2.0 support (more features to come):

- Transactional endpoint
- Node labels
- Schema index
- Get or create unique node


* Getting Started

Requirements:

- Go 1.1 or higher
- Neo4j 1.9 or higher (test suite currently requires 2.0.0-M03)

Installation:

  $ go get github.com/jmcvetta/neoism


* Connect

First we'll need to grab a connection to the Neo4j database:

.code presentation.go /^func connect/,/^}/

At this point we could enable _extremely_ verbose logging of every HTTP request and response by Napping, the underlying REST client:

  db.Session.Log = true


* Nodes & Relationships

Let's create some nodes, and relationships between them:

.code presentation.go /^func create/,/^}/


* Cypher - Transaction

Let's use Cypher to create a node and some relationships inside a transaction:

.code presentation.go /^func transaction/,/^}/


* Cypher - Single Query

Use Cypher to create relationships between several nodes:

.code presentation.go /^func cypher/,/^}/


* Cypher - Batch

Batch support for Cypher queries is very similar to using a transaction, except that the transaction is committed immediately upon success:

.code presentation.go /^func cleanup/,/^}/


* Unmarshaling Results

Neo4j returns Cypher query results in a format that is compact, but challenging to unmarshal into a struct.

Column names are returned in an array field.

Actual result data is returned in a seperate field as an array of arrays, where the outer array represents the rows, and the inner arrays represent the columns.

For example:

	{
	  "columns" : [ "type(r)", "n.name", "n.age" ],
	  "data" : [ [ "know", "him", 25 ], [ "know", "you", null ] ]
	}

Problem: the standard library `json` package can only unmarshal based on field name, not on position within an array.


* Unmarshaling Results (cont'd)

Current solution is to transform the result JSON so it can easily be unmarshaled into a slice of structs.  This is done by round-tripping though the marshaller.  This solution is robust, but inefficient.

	func (cq *CypherQuery) Unmarshal(v interface{}) error {
		// We do a round-trip thru the JSON marshaller.  A fairly simple way to
		// do type-safe unmarshalling, but perhaps not the most efficient solution.
		rs := make([]map[string]*json.RawMessage, len(cq.cr.Data))
		for rowNum, row := range cq.cr.Data {
			m := map[string]*json.RawMessage{}
			for colNum, col := range row {
				name := cq.cr.Columns[colNum]
				m[name] = col
			}
			rs[rowNum] = m
		}
		b, err := json.Marshal(rs)
		if err != nil {
			logPretty(err)
			return err
		}
		return json.Unmarshal(b, v)
	}


* To Do

General Features:

- More efficient unmarshaling of Cypher query results
- Graph algorithm support
- Traversals - security issues, see manual
- Think about how to support multiple versions of Neo4j, which may have  different APIs


Features for Neo4j 2.0:

- More complete support for unique nodes and relationships
- Create node with label. REST API cannot create a labeled node in a single operation, except using a Cypher query
- HTTP streaming support.  Will improve performance somewhat; but REST API does not currently support true streaming of results
